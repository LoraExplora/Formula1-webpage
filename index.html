				<b>☛ The average cost of a car is $7 million.</b>

				F1 cars are not bought; they are built for millions of dollars. Although companies don’t always give an exact price, the approximate cost is around $7 million. This approximate cost does not include design costs. Their price changes every year as design rules change.<br><br>
				<b>☛ Brake discs can reach 1,000 degrees Celsius</b>

				Brake discs in Formula One race cars can heat up to 1,000 degrees Celsius, comparable to molten lava’s temperature. This feat of brake discs was considered entirely impossible years ago, and what engineers are now working on can be mind-boggling.<br><br>

				<b>☛ The engine won’t start when it’s cold</b>

				Many F1 race engineers have concluded that it’s impossible to crank F1 pistons when the engine is cold. So that’s why they are always preheated before they hit the track. For the same reason, many cars have external motors and gearbox heater pumps continuously at operating temperature.<br><br>

				<b>☛ An F1 driver loses four pounds per race</b>

				For people who love cars and auto racing, F1 racing is one of the best ways to lose weight. Unbearable cockpit temperatures are the main reason drivers tend to lose up to 4 pounds per race..
				<br><br> 

                <b>☛ F1’s helmet is one of the world’s toughest</b>

				Considering that many injuries and accidents during a race involve the neck and head, the helmet used for F1 is one of the most durable in the world. Although the helmet is solid, it is still very lightweight. It is tested for fragmentation and deformation before it is used.<br><br> 

                <b>☛ Formula 1 cars can go upside down</b>

				Even a Formula 1 car can go upside down when the conditions are right. The aerodynamic downforce of an F1 car is what allows it to go upside down. Although there has been a lot of discussion about this, especially about automotive fluids, this possibility still holds true.
